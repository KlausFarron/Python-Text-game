# Python-Text-game

This was a little Python game I created for the very first script course ever.
It follows a theme of Lykaios knight from a story I created a long time ago hunting down a free magic creature.

I certainly bit more than I could chew at the time trying to implement closed door room that opens with levers which was far beyond what the assignment required.
